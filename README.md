# Testing Library
This is my basic testing library for use with basic problems. It contains Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and jQuery librarys, as well as my Spec.js and SpecRunner.html templates. The libraries do not belong to me. I am only providing an easy implementation. You must have Node and npm installed first.
